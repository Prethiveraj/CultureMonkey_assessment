# üß† CultureMonkey Internship Assessment ‚Äì Skill Trend Detector API

This project is part of the CultureMonkey Internship Assessment.  
It uses **Python** and **Flask** to build a REST API that detects **technical skills** from job descriptions and classifies them as either:

- `emerging`: less common skills
- `established`: widely used, popular skills

The classification is based on how frequently each skill appears in real-world job postings.
